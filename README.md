# SCModRepository
A much better way to manage mods instead of creating 70 repositories. Oh god what was I thinking?



## Contribution guide
Make a pull request. More info soon :^)


## How does this work?
The repository contains a .github folder, Space Engineers mod folders, and a .gitignore file.
### .github folder:
- contains the instructions what to do after a "push", currently set to upload to the steam workshop after the respective .yml file detects a change in the folder its looking for
### SE Mod folders:
- contains all the data that would load normally as an SE mod
### .gitignore file
- tells git what to exclude during a push (like .sln files in visual studio)
